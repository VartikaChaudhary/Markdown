# Welcome
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like (#) or (*).

## Bold
If you wish to write the words or sentences in bold you just have to use double underscord or asterik before and after the words. Just like this **hey there** or __hey there__.


## Italic
Now to use the italic just use a single astrik or a single underscore before and after the input. Example- *hello world* or _hello world_.

## Combine Bold and Italic
To use the combine bold and italic follow this-
#### Bold with Italic:
Use a underscore then double astrik before and after the words. Just like the gicen example-- _**its bold with italic**_
#### Italic with Bold:
Use a underscore before and after thee words and the double astrik sign within the italic whenever needed. Example- _its in italic **its bold** welocme to italic again_.

# Points

#### Ordered list
1. Asia
2. Africa
3. Russia

#### Underordered list

# Table
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:
Example--

| First Heading | Second Heading |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| First Name | Vartika |
| Last Name| Choudhary |

Its how you make a table

# Inline code
Inline code is nothing except putting code bewteen the paragraph.
like if I write <h3> it display all these as heading util I close it </h3>. To overcome this thing the inline code function is introducted. 
Here the code is written between backtricks and it displayed as a commonn text rather than treated as a code. 
Example- `<h1>`

# Javascript
```javascipt
 function add(num1, num2){
  return num1+num2;
 }
```

# HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
 <head>
 <title>Intro</title>
 </head>
 
 <body>
  <p>
  Hey, me, myself.
  </p>
 </body>
 
</html>
```

# Image
